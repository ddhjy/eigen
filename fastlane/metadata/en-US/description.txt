THE ART GENOME PROJECT®

Discover and learn about new art and artists you'll love through Artsy's The Art Genome Project, an ongoing study to map the characteristics (known as ‘genes’) that connect the world’s artists and artworks. There are over 500 genes including art-historical movements, subject matter, and formal qualities. For instance, Artsy might connect Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst via pop culture, and Botticelli and Ai Weiwei via metaphor/allegory.
